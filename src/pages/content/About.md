#### Capability Statement:

## Who we are:

At SK Solar Oz Pty Ltd we have been working with a world leading renewable energy contractor on
some of the largest solar farm projects in Australia. We have for a number of years successfully delivered the
installation of various types of solar panel and clamping systems. No matter the panel system to be installed
our work force will hit the ground running, this is due in no small part to our professional, skilled, experienced
workforce and also that we have prior experience and knowledge working with the many different types of
systems. As such there would be no steep learning curves when we commence installation. We also offer a
labour hire service to our client, to be used for anything such as civil scope, earthworks, concreting etc. As we
know renewable energy is a rapidly evolving industry and we have been a key part in the successful delivery of
many solar farm projects based on our ever expanding base of multi talented skill labour. We have also forged
great relationships with our clients who come back to us for return business time after time, they know A
construction are the only choice when they need to deliver a project safely, on time and under budget.
